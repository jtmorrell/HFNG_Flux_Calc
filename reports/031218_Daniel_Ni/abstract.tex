In this experiment we use the foil activation technique to measure the fast neutron flux in the Berkeley High Flux Neutron Generator (HFNG).  The irradiation began at 12:23 on 02/26/2018 and ended at 22:10 on 03/09/2018  The peak flux measured was (1.6$\pm$0.23)$\cdot 10^7$ [$\frac{n}{cm^2s}$] using the following monitor channel(s): $^{58}$Ni(n,p)$^{58}$Co.
