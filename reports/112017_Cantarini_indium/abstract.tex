In this experiment we use the foil activation technique to measure the fast neutron flux in the Berkeley High Flux Neutron Generator (HFNG).  The irradiation began at 9:24 on 11/20/2017 and ended at 22:11 on 11/20/2017  The peak flux measured was (7.55$\pm$0.63)$\cdot 10^6$ [$\frac{n}{cm^2s}$] using the following monitor channel(s): $^{115}$In(n,n')$^{115m}$In, $^{115}$In(n,$\gamma$)$^{116m}$In, $^{113}$In(n,n')$^{113m}$In.
