In this experiment we use the foil activation technique to measure the fast neutron flux in the Berkeley High Flux Neutron Generator (HFNG).  The irradiation began at 11:53 on 10/23/2017 and ended at 23:31 on 10/23/2017  The peak flux measured was (3.98$\pm$0.5)$\cdot 10^7$ [$\frac{n}{cm^2s}$] using the following monitor channel(s): $^{58}$Ni(n,p)$^{58}$Co.
